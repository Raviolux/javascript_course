        <p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to <br />make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.  For example, take the following line of content:</p>
        
        Obviously you can put text outside of everything!
        <br />
        <span id='this-span'>
          Span is like Div but without linebreaks on top and bottom!
        </span>

        <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. <hr />The class attribute allows you to give the element an identifier that can be used later to target the element with style information and other things.
          
          An attribute should always have the following:
          
              A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
              The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
              The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</p>

      <div class="modal">
        <div class="modal-content">
          <span class="close-modal">&times;</span>
          <p>Yes, you opened the modal box. Now what?
            <br>
            Many professional websites go online this way.
            In addition, you will need a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) program (see How much does it cost: software for more details) to actually transfer the website files over to the server. FTP  programs vary widely, but generally, you have to connect to your web server using details provided by your hosting company (typically username, password, hostname). Then the program shows you your local files and the web server's files in two windows, and provides a way for you to transfer files back and forth.
